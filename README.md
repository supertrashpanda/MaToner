# Ma Toner
I envision a voice generator that takes in major "sound laws" for systematic phonological changes from Middle Chinese, and produce the sounds of such a hypothetical descendent of Middle Chinese, thus it should be capable of simulating and generatign sounds of any existing dialect of modern Chinese (the Sinitic languages).   
For this repository, the text in the "the text.txt" file shall be processed and pronounced with only the "Ma" syllable in Mandarin Chinese, but using the corresponding tone (could be one of the four main tones or the neutral tone) of each Chinese character in the text in Mandarin, as the python script file is run.
