This repository is for the pilot project of one of my foremost ambitions in my life. I envision a voice generator that takes in major "sound laws" for systematic phonological changes from Middle Chinese, and produce the sounds of such a hypothetical descendent of Middle Chinese, thus it should be capable of generating sounds of any existing dialect of modern Chinese.
