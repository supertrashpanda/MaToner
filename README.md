# Ma Toner
This repository is for the pilot project of one of my foremost ambitions in my life. I envision a voice generator that takes in major "sound laws" for systematic phonological changes from Middle Chinese, and produce the sounds of such a hypothetical descendent of Middle Chinese, thus it should be capable of simulating and generating sounds of any existing dialect of modern Chinese.   
For this repository, the text in the "the text.txt" file shall be processed and pronounced with only the "Ma" syllable in Mandarin Chinese, but using the corresponding tone of each Chinese character in the text in Mandarin, as the python script file is run.
